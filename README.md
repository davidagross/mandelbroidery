mandelbroidery
==============

This is mandelbroidery, a MATLAB(R) script for creating a highly pixelated
portion of a mandelbrot set and creating a cross-stitch pattern from it.

For more information, please read the headers of the MATLAB(R) source files.

Interest
--------

This project came about after purchasing the cross-stitch / needlepoint 
DIY case for my next phone, an iPhone 5 [1] and wanting to create a design 
that was just my style.

After having worked with cellular automata in a previous project [2], I wanted
something equally interesting but also colorful.

Development
-----------

Please feel free to make changes, offer suggestions, and help me port this to
other languages of interet.  Thanks!
